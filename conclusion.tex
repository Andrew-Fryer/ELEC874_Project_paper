\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We are/are not able to fool Signet.
This was/was not anticipated.

We do it using (inverted) FGSM, but we could alternatively do it by lots of trial and error...?
    I should test this!

This qualitatively shows that SigNet's [desicion] is largely influenced by [].


I speculate that SigNet is learning info about the cameras/lighting conditions used for each person/or set up maybe?
...my thinking is that the pertebation looked like background noise, the genuine had all zeros in the background, and the forge had non-zero small values in the background...
