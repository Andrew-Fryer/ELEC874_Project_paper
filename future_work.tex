\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future_work}
Implement triplet loss on a SigNet-like network.

If I didn't get to implementing a cool threshold I should talk about that here...
TODO: talk about Gaussian threshold idea

Work has already been done in improving network's by training them an adversarial examples created using FGSM and similar methods.
