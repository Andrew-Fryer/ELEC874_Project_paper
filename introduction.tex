\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Authentication is the process of verifying an individual's identity and is critical to the security of many computer applications and other systems.
Authentication is generally done by testing a user's knowledge, ownership, or inherence factors, which could be a password, a token, or a biometric identifier, respectively\cite{authentication}.

Face recognition and verification is used for authentication in some modern software systems.
With emergence of machine learning, there has been considerable work done on the problem of performing automating authentication based on face verification\cite{sig_net}.

Handwritten signatures have a long history of being a means of authentication.
Therefore, it would be useful to apply techniques used in face verification to signature verfication, which is a very complex problem in biometrics because it requires modelling minute but critical details between a genuine signature and a skilled falsification\cite{sig_net}.

The difficulty of this problem is increased for systems that need to determine whether a signature is a forge with a small number of genuine signatures for the individual because machine learning techniques generally require large quantities of data.

Additionally, if the data used for verification is collected electronically, an attacker could modify it using software with the intent of fooling the verification system.

It has been proved that deep learning models are ``overly confident at points that do not occur in the data distribution, and these confident predictions are often highly incorrect'', which presents opportunities for a clever attacker to trick a verfication system built on many machine learning models including neural networks\cite{goodfellow}.
