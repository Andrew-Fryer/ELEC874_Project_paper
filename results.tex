\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

Here's a table of the accuracy (true/false positive/negative matix).
% todo: compute matrix...

Here's a genuine and a forge and we apply various epsilon values and also repeat...
    There are diminising returns on continually nudging a forge.

Here's how well we trick SigNet...

Here's the same thing with 2 genuines of different signatures.

Here's the same thing with 2 genuines of the same signature.



random noise can score well...

-------------------------------------------------

There are pure 0s in the forge, but not the original...
what if I add a bit of random noise to the forge?

I wonder if making the pixels boolean would help or hurt signet/advarsary...





WAT
    scaling the input to the net doesn't seem to change its output (latent) vector
    It that because it is doing some sort of normalization??
